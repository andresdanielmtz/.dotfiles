## Personal Configuration

> This repository is mostly created and maintained with backup purposes in mind, it is not meant to be a configuration you should copy or integrate into your own. Some tools are installed (like Hyprland) but are not used whatsoever. So please keep that in mind. 

**Current setup:** Fedora 40 with i3WM 4.23.

You (andresdanielmtz from the future) should have the following dependencies installed for the optimal fedora/i3 experience.

- maim (screenshots)
- polybar
- xorg-server (`sudo dnf install @base-x`)
- dmenu

Most of them can be installed using plain `dnf`, others, like (x-org) require a specific command / are from a specific library.

### Wallpaper

Wallpaper is defined by `i3/.config` file, it is a static route so you might want to rename the name of your file before setting it there.
